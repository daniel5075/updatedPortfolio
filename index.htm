        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Full-Stack Web Developer leveraging degrees in psychology and emergency management to build a more intuitive
            user experience on the web and delivering those in a timely manner. Recently earned a certificate in Full
            Stack Development from Southern Methodist University, with newly developed skills in JavaScript, CSS,
            React.js, and responsive web design. Known as an innovative problem-solver passionate about developing apps,
            with a focus on mobile-first design and development.

            With each project, my aim is to best engage my audience for an impactful user-experience. I applied aspects
            of UX and agile development in a recent project where I worked in a team of four to develop a single-page
            MERN app that helps local business owners track their sales, inventory and attendance at specialty events.
            Excited to leverage skills in the future as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team in order to build
            better experiences on the web.</p>
